# practical-python-scripts

A few small scripts I wrote for fun, which might be a bit useful. Future maintenance is uncertain.

All scripts in this repository are released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

## scripts list

- `fibonacci.py`: This is a script that uses a recursive algorithm to generate the value of the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
- `fibonacciArray.py`: This is a Python script that generates a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers by summing the last two elements of the list and appending the sum to the list iteratively.
- `rsaTool.py`: RSA Key Pair Utility Module for CTF Challenges
- `Vigenère.py`: A script for encrypting arbitrary Unicode characters using an approach derived from the Vigenère cipher.
- `Vigenère GUI.py`: `Vigenère.py` with GUI
